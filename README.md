moos-hello
==========
Introductory project to the [MOOS](https://github.com/themoos/core-moos/) communications framework.  One thread in the example program generates integers.  Two other consumer threads read the integer value at a set interval while publishing theier latency statistics.  The final thread prints out the latency statistics at another fixed interval.
